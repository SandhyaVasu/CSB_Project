# On Tracking the Dynamics of the Gut’s Butyrate Factories
This repository contains the codes, model files, diets and images obtained as part of a project for a course — Computational Systems Biology (2025). 

Abstract: This project investigates the dynamics of the cross-feeding gut microbe pair —
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium adolescentis which together drive efficient
butyrate production. Butyrate is renowned to be a vital metabolite that performs several
regulatory roles in the human body, mainly the alleviation of neurological conditions. In terms
of dynamics, this work tracks the species’ growth and butyrate secretion profiles across different
nutritional conditions. An ecological perspective is also provided in terms of characterising
their interaction profile and testing the Black Queen Hypothesis. Further, dynamic flux
balance analysis is employed to explore growth patterns and butyrate efflux over time. Finally,
Lactobacillus brevis is added as a third member, and the effects are noted. Another ecological
viewpoint is to sequentially add the three species to gauge which combination of succession
could be ecologically feasible for the community to thrive. The genome-scale metabolic models
of the species were employed for the simulations. Results ascertain that the gluten-free and highfibre
diets support maximum butyrate production with Bifidobacterium adolescentis behaving
like a parasite in most diets. When grown in monoculture and co-culture, F. prausnitzii and B.
adolescentis declined in growth, with butyrate production being higher in co-culture compared to
monoculture. Sequential invasion of these two species along with L. brevis revealed that certain
orders of invasions support both growth and butyrate production. In sum, the study paves the
way for the optimal design of probiotic intervention strategies to get the best outcomes.
